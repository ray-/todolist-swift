ToDoList iOS app writen in Swift
==============
This is based on the basic [iOS tutorial for making an app](https://developer.apple.com/library/iOS/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/index.html) except this code is adapted for swift.

The reference documentation is added as a PDF.

There are still some issues with the XCODE 6 beta specifically with unwind segue actions not being detected in Interface Builder. The work arounds are in this code.
